I wanted to create docs for the course I enrolled which would help me for future reference, the course offers subtitle and I don't wanted to type and recreate same content for docs so I decided to convert those subtitle files into text files and then copy content into [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (which is another repo).

Here is how I manage to do the above process using python:
