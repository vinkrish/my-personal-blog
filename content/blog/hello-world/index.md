title: Hello World

When starting to learn new programming language - historically, it has became rudimentary to start with **"Hello World"** example, so I decided to keep this markdown file which was originally included in gatsby starter blog, but changed content to have my say.

Since this is my first blog I thought why not try to remember all programming languages/scripts I've tried my hands on:  
```sh
C
C++
Java
Python
PHP
C#
Swift
JavaScript
```

I'll be sharing few things from my past experience and will suffix language in title for identifying content easily if I went on blogging more in future.
